# Congrats, you found my keys. Normally, you would want to put them as secret tokens in your server or .env file, but since git doesn't let me push a .env and we're still in development stage, these keys are public.
# But this would be a good way for someone to access by database and gain access to my slack channel which isn't fun, so please use encrypted secret token on your server
